# Database Resource Optimization with Machine Learning

### Overview

In this lab, we will explore how to apply Machine Learning (ML) to optimize database resources and performance. This is a breakthrough approach in modern systems, helping to automate performance tuning, ensure stability and save operational costs.

Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence that provides systems with the ability to "learn" from historical data to make intelligent decisions. In this topic, you will learn how ML models analyze performance metrics and workloads to automate tasks such as configuration tuning and query optimization.

In addition, we will also explore advanced supporting components such as Resource Forecasting to allocate CPU and memory reasonably, avoiding waste.

Make sure you have mastered the basic knowledge of Database Administration, Machine Learning concepts and system monitoring processes before starting deployment.
